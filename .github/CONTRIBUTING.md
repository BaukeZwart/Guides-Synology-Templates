# Contributing Guidelines

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

Here you will find a set of guidelines for contributing to Guides-Synology-Templates which is part of TRaSH Guides, Which you can find [HERE](https://trash-guides.info/),
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Guidelines

- Make sure you're editing the latest version.
- If you propose changes make sure it doesn't break anything else in the Guides or any other templates.
- If you add a new template for a application take a look at [DockSTARTer](https://github.com/GhostWriters/DockSTARTer/tree/master/compose/.apps) for examples being I used them as base for the others templates.
- Try to be consistent with the existing templates.

## Recommendations

- use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing and creating.
